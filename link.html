            What Are Chibis?
        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Chibi means short or small, it usually means in anime and manga a child.
            <br>
            Or, a character with a small body and a big head.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is an Example:
            <br>
            <img width="430px" src="bunny 1.jpg">
            <img width="430px" src="bunny 2.jpg">
        </h2>
            <h2>
                Chibis were my favorite type of anime and manga for a long time
                <br>
                because they so cute and funny. Because of this I hope you enjoy them too!
